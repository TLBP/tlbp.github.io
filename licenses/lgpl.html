    This version of the <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> Lesser General Public License
    incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the

    additional permissions listed below.

        <p>
    As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the
    <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> Lesser General Public License, and the
    “<abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> <abbr class="acronym">GPL</abbr>” refers to
    version 3 of the <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr> General Public License.
  </p>
        <p>
    “The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License,
    other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
  </p>
        <p>
    An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface
    provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
    Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of
    using an interface provided by the Library.
  </p>
        <p>
    A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an
    Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library with
    which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked
    Version”.
  </p>
        <p>
    The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the
    Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for
    portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on
    the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
  </p>
        <p>
    The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means
    the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
    and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
    Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

        <p>
    You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without
    being bound by section 3 of the <abbr class="acronym">GNU</abbr>
    <abbr class="acronym">GPL</abbr>.

        <p>
    If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility
    refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the
    facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked),
    then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

        that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data,
        the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose
        remains meaningful, or

  </h2>
        <p>
    The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a
    header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object code
    under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is
    not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors,
    or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in

    such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you

    If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
