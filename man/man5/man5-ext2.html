          <p>
   The  second,  third,  and fourth extended file systems, or ext2, ext3, and ext4 as they are commonly known, are Linux file systems that have historically been the default file  system  for  many  Linux distributions.   They are general purpose file systems that have been designed for extensibility and backwards compatibility.  In particular, file systems previously intended for use with the ext2  and ext3  file systems can be mounted using the ext4 file system driver, and indeed in many modern Linux distributions, the ext4 file system driver has been configured to handle mount requests for ext2 and ext3 file systems.

          <h2>DOSYA SİSTEMİNİN ÖZELLİKLERİ</h2>
          <p>
   A  file system formatted for ext2, ext3, or ext4 can have some collection of the following file system feature flags enabled.  Some of these features are not supported by all implementations  of  the ext2,  ext3, and ext4 file system drivers, depending on Linux kernel version in use.  On other operating systems, such as the GNU/HURD or FreeBSD, only a very restrictive set of file system  features may be supported in their implementations of ext2.

      Enables the file system to be larger than 2^32 blocks.  This feature is set automatically, as needed, but it can be useful to specify this feature explicitly if the file system might need o be resized larger than 2^32 blocks, even if it was smaller than that threshold when it was originally created.  Note that some older kernels and older versions of  e2fsprogs  will  not support file systems with this ext4 feature enabled.

      This  ext4  feature  enables  clustered block allocation, so that the unit of allocation is a power of two number of blocks.  That is, each bit in the what had traditionally been known as the block allocation bitmap now indicates whether a cluster is in use or not, where a cluster is by default composed of 16 blocks.  This feature can decrease the time spent on doing block allocation  and  brings  smaller  fragmentation, especially for large files.  The size can be specified using the mke2fs -C option.

      Normally, ext4 allows an inode to have no more than 65,000 hard links.  This applies to regular files as well as directories, which means that there can be no more than 64,998 subdirectories in a directory (because each of the '.' and '..' entries, as well as the directory entry for the directory in its parent directory counts as a hard  link).   This  feature  lifts this limit by causing ext4 to use a link count of 1 to indicate that the number of hard links to a directory is not known when the link count might exceed the maximum count limit.

      This ext4 feature allows the mapping of logical block numbers for a particular inode to physical blocks on the storage device to be stored using an extent tree, which is  a  more  efficient  data  structure  than  the traditional indirect block scheme used by the ext2 and ext3 file systems.  The use of the extent tree decreases metadata block  overhead,  improves  file system  performance,  and  decreases  the needed to run e2fsck(8) on the file system.

      This ext4 feature allows file systems to be resized on-line without explicitly needing to reserve space for growth in the size of the block group descriptors.  This scheme is also  used to  resize  file  systems which are larger than 2^32 blocks.  It is not recommended that this feature be set when a file system is created, since this  alternate  method  of  storing  the block  group  descriptors  will slow down the time needed to mount the file system, and newer kernels can automatically set this feature as necessary when doing an online  resize  and  no more reserved space is available in the resize inode.

      This file system feature is set on all modern ext2, ext3, and ext4 file  systems.   It  indicates  that backup copies of the superblock and block group descriptors are present only in a few block groups, not all of them.

      This feature indicates that there will only be at most two backup superblocks and block group descriptors.  The block groups used to store the backup superblock(s) and blockgroup descriptor(s) are stored in the superblock, but typically, one will be located at the  beginning  of block  group  #1, and one in the last block group in the file system.  This feature is essentially a more extreme version of sparse_super and is designed to allow a much larger percentage of the disk to have contiguous blocks available for data files.

This feature  allows the use of specialized encryption settings that make use of the inode numbers and UUID.  Note that the encrypt feature still needs to be enabled separately.  stable_inodes is a "compat" feature, so old kernels will allow it.

      This  ext4  file  system feature indicates that the block group descriptors will be protected using checksums, making it safe for mke2fs(8) to create a file  system  without  initializing all  of  the  block groups.  The kernel will keep a high watermark of unused inodes, and initialize inode tables and blocks lazily.  This feature speeds up the time to  check  the  file system  using  e2fsck(8), and it also speeds up the time required for mke2fs(8) to create the file system.

      Enables support for verity protected files.  Verity files are readonly,  and  their  data  is transparently  verified  against  a  Merkle  tree hidden past the end of the file.  Using the Merkle tree's root hash, a verity file can be efficiently authenticated, independent  of  the file's size.

      This  feature  is most useful for authenticating important read-only files on read-write file systems.  If the file system itself is read-only, then using dm-verity  to  authenticate  the entire block device may provide much better security.

       Instead of using the normal superblock, use an alternative superblock specified by  n.   This option  is  normally  used  when  the primary superblock has been corrupted.  The location of backup superblocks is dependent on the file system's blocksize,  the  number  of  blocks  per group, and features such as sparse_super.
     </p>
                  <p>
      Additional  backup superblocks can be determined by using the mke2fs program using the -n option to print out where the superblocks exist, supposing mke2fs is  supplied  with  arguments that  are  consistent  with  the  file  system's  layout  (e.g.  blocksize, blocks per group, sparse_super, etc.).

      The block number here uses 1 k units. Thus, if you want to use logical block 32768 on a  file system with 4 k blocks, use "sb=131072".

       This  disables / enables the use of write barriers in the jbd code.  barrier=0 disables, barrier=1 enables (default). This also requires an IO stack which can support barriers,  and  if jbd  gets  an error on a barrier write, it will disable barriers again with a warning.  Write barriers enforce proper on-disk ordering of  journal  commits,  making  volatile  disk  write caches safe to use, at some performance penalty.  If your disks are battery-backed in one way or another, disabling barriers may safely improve performance.

       Apart from the old quota system (as in ext2, jqfmt=vfsold aka version 1 quota) ext3 also supports journaled quotas (version 2 quota). jqfmt=vfsv0 or jqfmt=vfsv1 enables  journaled  quotas.

       Maximum amount of time ext4 should wait for additional file system operations to be batch together  with  a  synchronous write operation. Since a synchronous write operation is going to force a commit and then a wait for the I/O complete, it doesn't cost much, and can be a  huge throughput  win, we wait for a small amount of time to see if any other transactions can piggyback on the synchronous write. The algorithm used is designed to automatically tune for the speed  of the disk, by measuring the amount of time (on average) that it takes to finish committing a transaction. Call this time the "commit time".  If the time  that  the  transaction has  been running is less than the commit time, ext4 will try sleeping for the commit time to see if other operations will  join  the  transaction.  The  commit  time  is  capped  by  the max_batch_time,  which  defaults to 15000 µs (15 ms). This optimization can be turned off entirely by setting max_batch_time to 0.

       Controls whether or not ext4 should use the DIO read locking. If the dioread_nolock option is specified ext4 will allocate uninitialized extent before buffer write and convert the  extent to  initialized  after IO completes.  This approach allows ext4 code to avoid using inode mutex, which improves scalability on high speed storages. However this does not work with  data journaling  and  dioread_nolock  option  will  be  ignored  with  kernel  warning.  Note that dioread_nolock code path is only used for extent-based files.  Because  of  the  restrictions this options comprises it is off by default (e.g. dioread_lock).
